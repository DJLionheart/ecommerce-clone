                <h2>Cleaning your mounted fine art photograph</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>Extreme caution should be used whenever it is necessary to clean the surface of your Fine Art photograph. Per the manufacturer’s instructions, dust the picture glazing with a soft, damp cloth or chamois. Apply only light pressure, rinse with clean water, and dry by blotting the cloth. Dry or gritty cloths may cause surface scratches and create a static electric charge on the surface. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Do not use window cleaning sprays, kitchen scouring compounds, or solvents such as acetone, gasoline, or lacquer thinner to clean your image, as this may cause permanent damage to your image.</p>

                <h2>Cleaning the frame</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>Our wood frames have a protective wax finish that, when handled properly, should not require care other than periodic dusting. A soft, dry cloth may be used to remove spots or debris. Avoid the use of liquid and chemical cleaning products, as these will cause the protective finish to deteriorate over time. A high-quality microfiber cloth may be used on our black cube and stainless steel frames. Apply only light pressure, rinse with clean water, and dry by blotting the cloth. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>We recommend using compressed or canned air to remove any surface dust that accumulates on the liner over time, making sure that no moisture is expelled from the can during the cleaning process.</p>

                <h2>Lighting</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>Lighting your image properly involves using a mixture of spotlights and spreads. The proper degree of spread will depend on the distance of the light fixture from the photograph. While several light bulbs can sufficiently light your image, we use MR16 halogen bulbs in all Lik Galleries. It is best to seek the advice of an electrician or lighting professional to ensure the proper balance of light and presentation of your art.</p>

                <h2>Environment</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>Our Fine Art is developed using the most advanced technology and the finest materials. While measures have been taken to provide UV protection, it is recommended to avoid displaying your photograph in direct sunlight, high humidity, or high temperatures.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Temperatures in excess of 75°F, direct sunlight, or humidity above approximately 60% could cause damage to your image, including but not limited to fading in the photograph or the formation of bubbles on the mounted image.</p>
